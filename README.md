## EMG Claw

Arduino Code for EMG Claw on Arduino IDE platform. Final Project for BME 261L with other collaborators, Felipe Castro, Enrique Villacres, and Thaneshwor Pandey. I was in charge of programming for Arduino in combination with myoware sensors. Please refer to documentation below for overview of prototype.

## Code Features

Code can be primarily broken down into two phases. 
  * Phase 1 refers to calibration phase as noted in documentation. 
  * Phase 2 is myoware response to Arduino signals.
